<h2>Instructions</h2>

<section class="text-center">
  <div class="d-flex flex-column mb-4">
    <p>Bombsweeper works just like Minesweeper only with bombs instead of mines :)</p>

    <p>Left click on a square to reveal it. Revealing the first square starts the timer (unless it's a bomb!)</p> 
    
    <p>If you reveal a square with a bomb, you lose. If the revealed square is safe it will show the number of (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) adjecent squares with bombs</p> 
    
    <p>If no surrounding squares have bombs, the revealed square will appear blank and the surrounding safe squares will automatically be revealed (triggering a cascade of square reveals)</p>

    <p>You can right click an unrevealed square to mark it with a flag if you suspect it has a bomb. Right clicking a flagged square removes the flag</p>

    <p>Once all the safe squares have been revealed, you win the game. The timer will stop and a "Submit Time" button will appear. If you're logged in, you can click the button to save your time. It will then appear on your profile (and on the scoreboard if it's good enough)</p>

    <p>You can reset the board and the timer at any time by clicking the "Reset" button</p>

    <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
